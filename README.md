This is my profile website built with Streamlit and linked to sqlite database.  The database is accessed through
a connection engine.  The tables in the database are initialized with the Profiles class and data is fetched through 
queries.

My profile is broken down into categories, each of which is stored/loaded in the database table using dictionaries or lists.
Tables consist of:
  - Expertise
  - Skills
  - Work History
  - Highlights
  - Project Links
  - Training & Knowledge
    - Python
    - Database
    - Accounting
